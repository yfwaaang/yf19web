            Poster design with AR experience for Jean Arp's exhibition in UK. The exhibition comprises over 70 loans of work, the majority of which have never been on display in the UK. As well as drawings, collages, paintings, wood reliefs and sculptures, the exhibition explores Arp’s poetry, adding a new dimension to his biomorphic sculptures with flashes of the artist’s ingenuity.

            With the idea of transfer poetrys to collages and sculpture, I designed a series of poster utilized AR technique add a new dimention to the poster.
